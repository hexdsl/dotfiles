# Configurations for GNU/Linux

## Setup overview

**This is a non-exhaustive list:**

- Operating System *Arch Linux* (GNU/Linux). Because I like a rolling-release distro, having the newest packages, and access to probably the best user wiki around.
- Window manager *i3-gaps*. For a keyboard-centric, highly-customisable, tilling window manager.
- Bar *polybar*. Flexible, easy-to-use, system bar.
- Compositor *compton*. For transparency and some mildly fancy effects like shadows.
- Terminal emulator *urxvt*. Customisable, lightweight, simple terminal.
- Text editor *vim*. The decent text editor that is not included with Emacs.
- File Manager *ranger*. Console application, extensible, and straightforward.
- Mail client *mutt*. Robust, reliable, email client for communicating via the console.
- Feed reader *newsboat*. Simple RSS reader with podcasting capabilities.
- Music server *mpd*. Music Player Daemon works in the background, enabling all sorts of clients to interface with it.
- Music client *ncmpcpp*. Console based MPD interface.
- GUI Music client *Cantata*. Qt app to interface with MPD. Fully featured.
- Program launcher *rofi*. Actually the program is quite more than that, but I mostly use it for launching programs.
- PDF viewer *zathura*. Vi-like keybindings for document viewing.
- Notifications *dunst*. Highly customisable notifications daemon. Gets the job done.
- Fonts *IBM Plex* family, as well as *DejaVu Sans Mono* and *DejaVu Sans*.
- Icon font *Font Awesome*. For adding some visual flair to the system bar.
- GTK Theme *Adapta*.
- GTK Icon theme *Papirus*.
