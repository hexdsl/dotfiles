# Configurations for GNU/Linux on my laptop

## Setup overview (Arch Linux)

Here I include only the main differences with my desktop setup.

- Window manager `bspwm`. Went with something slightly different. I am starting to like it more than `i3-gaps`.
- Bar `polybar` (AUR). Includes modules specific to `bspwm` and the laptop's hardware.
